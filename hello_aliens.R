cat("The human world is full of a variety of different creatures, with one of the most prominent being human beings. We have taken over a large portion of the world, and stand at the top as one of the most powerful and deadly predators of the planet. This does not mean we are savages or monsters, but rather we are held above many other species on this planet, and would be the first point of contact if you were to seek intelligent life on Earth. However, despite our fascination with space and life on other planets, we are also very afraid and paranoid of space-based warfare. Bear in mind that at first contact, we come in peace, and hope you too will approach with caution and friendship. However, if you do not come in peace, we will not hesitate to protect our planet from outside dangers. When or if you decide to descend to Earth, I would perhaps recommend greeting humans in a colloquial and friendly manner, so that you do not scare them. Be sure to give a gentle greeting, and perhaps say 'Hey fam!' or 'What up dawgs?' to establish fast friendship.")
